How to 
========

If you'd like to use this keyboard layout simply download/clone the repo and upload the `nike_basketball.svg` as your custom layout file on the [product page](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keycap-set/104-key-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html).

Now if you want to edit the layout or create your own, I recommend watching [The Wiggin WASD keyboard tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3XuDNFCfWg).
